## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My untitled project is a web application that allows users to track, display, buy, sell, and trade their physical video games. The users will be able to keep a digital collection of their video games, follow other users, and put up games to trade or sell to other collectors.
This project was inspired by the desire for a place to search and trade for rare games. But on top of that, people who still collect physical games want to not only show off their large collections, but also keep track of them.
### Features
Search
Login
User profiles with game collections
Edit user profile
Follow other users
Add/Remove games from collections
Upload photos
Submit a new game to be added to the application’s database
### Technologies
C#
ASP.NET MVC
SQL
Entity Framework
### What I'll Have to Learn
How to use FTP (file-transfer-protocol)
How to manage images in a database
Probably a bunch of other stuff I just haven’t realized yet
